# Welcome!

This sit will provide a collection of sources related to Android Development and tooling, including IDEs, CVS and Gradle, the most used JVM build system.

Plenty of information comes from the inspiration  of dozens of good developers who spent their time sharing what they love. The initial idea of collecting sources was centralizing all the valuable information I learnt since I started doing Android Development. Hopefully by gathering and sharing some of that information will be useful for you too.
