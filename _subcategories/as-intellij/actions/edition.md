### Default

- `⌃ + ⇧ + space` ⟹ Completion - SmartType
- `⌥ + /` ⟹ Hippie Completion (it will look for possible variables named that way)

- Alt, Alt hold or holing Alt + moving mouse ⟹ Multi cursor

- `⌃ + G` ⟹ Select a word and keep pressing `⌃ + G` to get selected all their ocurrences. More info [__here__](https://youtu.be/eq3KiAH4IBI?t=1195)
- `⌃ + ⌘ + G` ⟹ Will select all the ocurrences of the desired word (same as above but less effort)

- `⌃ + ⌥ + i` ⟹ Auto indent lines (very good if you have a bunch of code selected, it's gonna indent it for you). Same as using `⌘ + ⇧ + l` (reformatting) but for small pieces of code.

- `⌘ + ⇧ + ↵`⟹ Complete current statement (introduces semicolons or brakets or whatever you need to end up the line)

- `⌃ + t` ⟹ Refactor options
